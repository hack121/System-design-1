# System design
I like to document system design learning processing. Starting from May 10 to June 10 2018, I prepared my first system design onsite. 

From May 10 to June 10, I started to learn system design in quickest way. I got a coach and then I learned quickly big data, Cassadra database, redis, load balancer etc. 

Here are some blogs to document my learning:
